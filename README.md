# KKTrain
This repository holds the scripts used to train the ANNs used in the KinKal track fitting adapter for the Mu2e experiment

The first step to run the notebook is to install a kernel that includes support for everything listed in requirements.txt. For working on nersc, see https://docs.nersc.gov/services/jupyter/#conda-environments-as-kernels Then, you can load a particular notebook. Note that data is stored on NERSC in: /global/cfs/cdirs/m3712/Mu2e/TrkAna

TrainBkg.ipynb is used to separate true electron track hits from those generated by background particles
TrainLRDrift.ipynb is used to separate hits which have accurate drift information, including left-right sign, from hits with either poor drift measurement (due to ion cluster effects) or an ambiguous left-right sign.
